  "informationFirstPara": "We are building technology to detect the earliest signs of an earthquake and issue alerts. The technology could provide people critical time to seek cover or exit buildings before shaking arrives.",
  "informationSecPara": " OpenEEW is a growing project. We need volunteers to install sensors, start networks in seismically vulnerable regions, and contribute to the next generation of OpenEEW technology.",
